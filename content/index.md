## about 

Hi, I'm Barkat. I'm an entrepreneur and operator. I usually join start-ups as one of the first 'business' hires. I enjoy tinkering and taking things 0 to 1, starting with 1% idea and 99% iteration. I value agency and grit most. I enjoy working with like-minded, mission driven people.
## corpo nero

Corpo Nero is a unique exploration at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and business. Like a blackbody in physics, I seek to absorb and assimilate diverse ideas, providing fresh insights and unconventional perspectives. Thinking in progress.
