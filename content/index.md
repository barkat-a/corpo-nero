Corpo Nero is a unique exploration at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and art. Like a blackbody in physics, I seek to absorb and assimilate diverse ideas, providing fresh insights and unconventional perspectives. By traversing mental territories, I aim to chart new connections between distinct areas of thought. My intention with this space is to learn in public. I hope to equip readers with new mental models and cognitive tools to navigate our increasingly complex world. 

Join me on this journey of discovery for a unique blend of ideas you wonâ€™t find anywhere else.
