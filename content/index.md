Corpo Nero is a unique exploration at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and art. Like a blackbody in physics, I seek to absorb and assimilate diverse ideas, providing fresh insights and unconventional perspectives. By traversing mental territories, I aim to chart new connections between distinct areas of thought. Our goal is to equip readers with new mental models and cognitive tools to navigate our increasingly complex world.

Join me on this journey of discovery for a unique blend of ideas you wonâ€™t find anywhere else.
