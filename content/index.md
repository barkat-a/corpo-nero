## about 

Hi, I’m Barkat — an entrepreneur and operator. I typically join startups early on as one of the first business hires. I enjoy tinkering and taking ideas from 0 to 1, starting with a 1% concept and evolving it through 99% iteration. I value agency and grit. I enjoy working with like-minded, mission-driven people — smaller teams are better.
## corpo nero

Corpo Nero is a unique exploration at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and business. Like a blackbody in physics, I seek to absorb and assimilate diverse ideas, providing fresh insights and unconventional perspectives. This is a collection of my notes and thinking in progress.
