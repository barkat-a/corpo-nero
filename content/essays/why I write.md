# why I read (and why I didn't write)

For the longest time, despite wanting to write, I didn't. For one, I always conflated doing poorly in school at writing to being some innate deficiency. I thought may be good writing comes easily to others but is only painstaking difficult for me. Like a teacher at some point should've told me, "wow your writing is great, I should write more". I finally see the wisdom behind Tyler Cowen's [advice](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html) on the high-return activity of raising others’ aspirations. I would have started sooner. So, instead of writing, I just read.

Reading can be done passively, without judgement and inner criticism. I read a lot. I enjoyed reading longer form essays, newsletters and articles (checkout: [[a list of every blog or newsletter I've ever read]]). I felt like an article exploring a topic in 20-30 minutes was an ideal length to . Anything shorter would be too surface level. I found this length be lower stakes and opportunity cost than a book. However, reading long-form book reviews really highlighted what books would be worth reading and made my reading list grow. If someone can write a 10,000 word review on a book, there must be enough density and thought provoking insight to warrant a read. I deleted social media and would fill any idle and in-between time with reading on my read-it-later app, Pocket. Most people online sharing in the top percentile of pocket readers were around 1M words. I don't know where this put me, but my lowest year on pocket is 2.8M words. One year, I had read 32.6M words:

I think this is the most I've ever seen, of the screenshots shared. It's surprising how much small 'transitory' time adds up. Also, surprise the more you read the larger your reading list grows. I don't know how much I've retained of all these years but I'm glad to have read it and refined my tastes to know what I like reading and where the density of information I want to learn about lies. It's crazy what a little FOMO and imposter syndrome can do for motivation. In some ways, this essay is an elaborate way to use this screenshot, as I don't live in the Bay Area and cannot show it to people at parties.

# kipplerization

Reading great writing, only deepened my conviction that I should not write. I had nothing important to say or it had already been said, better, by someone else. I thought reading more would eventually make my ideas worth sharing and writing worth reading. After having read fairly widely, it seems so much  of what is written goes unread. I was afraid of contributing to this kipperlization of the web:

For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more."

Initially, seeing LLMs and generative AI advance, I wondered if the future would just be different agents reading and writing to each other. However, I've come out of the other side of these fears and anxieties. I now see writing now as a way of stress testing ideas and a tool for clarifying thought. A way of galvanizing and 'steelmanning' arguments. Writing things down, even if no one is reading them, shows holes and gaps in thinking. You may have glossed over a detail which the argument hinges on. I, now, see the value in honing a thought overtime. Overcoming the fear and doubt of not knowing something as well as I thought I did and hope to be better because of it.

# working in public vs. working in stealth

Aside from looking stupid or being on the wrong side of the culture war and getting character assasinated, working in 

So much attention is  monopolized by a few people and rightly so, they've who've 'earned' their audience through trust, rigor and consistency. but i now see the benefit of garnering a small audience - even having 1 person with overlapping niche interests is enough to warrant having written something.

work in stealth gives you a shield to criticism or delays user feedback. I some ways its probably the most pure creatively, if you have a chaste vision of what you want to create and don't want feedback adulterating you're idea. IT's prefereable to protect this and create somethign purley fhow you want it. (or you can create albums like kanye and use feedback to chop up). 

1. I write to clarify my thoughts and if no one reads it - that's ok as I would have further crystalized my opinons 
2. However, a big byproduct if your writing gets read is that you'll find like minded people - what is the price of finding a adjacent thinker in an obscure mix of similar tastes/prclivities to accelerate your learning. The amount of mistakes or deadends you can find for them and vice versa would take you orders of magnitude longer if you're toiling away in obscruity.

 you would be able to develop a unique voice that is more refined and robust, more so than if you writing alone or with limited dist.

# why you should read anything I write

I hope to write about or point you to things that you might like which might be hard to find or surface otherwise. I hope to add or frame things in unique ways or synthesize combine discipline which usually do not collide. I'm constantly asking what generalizable conclusions can be drawn from reading something, which could be applied from one domain to the other. How can this change or challenge our conventional understanding of this phenomena? If this sort of thing interests you, I hope you will keep reading.

Check a few of the pieces I'm working on [[now]]. I hope you'll stick around and I can earn your trust.

“The problem with an essay like this is that if I take on the first role and discuss my private reasons for writing, which have to do with wanting to be seen, wanting to be someone, with ambition and desire for success, I will come off as self-centered, shallow, and more than a little stupid, while if I focus on the other two roles, the existential side of writing and the function of writing in society, I will seem conceited, self-important, and perhaps also megalomaniac. But as it happens, writing is precisely about disregarding how something seems in the eyes of others, it is precisely about freeing oneself from all kinds of judgments and from posturing and positioning. Writing is about making something accessible, allowing something to reveal itself. Whatever it is that reveals itself may well be something already known, for there is hardly anything uncharted in the human psyche or in the world anymore, but it has to show itself unguardedly, with a kind of trust.”

“The contradiction between the illimitable that dwells within us and our simultaneous limitation and earthboundness is the driving force behind all literature and all art, or so I believe, but not only that; the longing to equalize the difference, suspend the contradiction and simply exist in the world, undifferentiated from it, is also an important part of all religious practice.”

““What we seek in art is meaning. The meaningful carries an obligation. With obligation come consequences. …meaningful and important, connected with all that is important in life, and not only do you see it, at times you even reaffirm your commitment to it. That is what art does, it is essential. But it is still just an illusion, your emotions are engaged by a product of the imagination, the obligation isn’t real, it is metaphorical.”

“Yes, I write because I want to open the world. But when I sit down at my desk and switch on my computer, there is no way to get there, for language carries its own meaning, form carries its own meaning, and that which seemed so evident within me, so luminously clear and simple, and so near to me, to what I am, changes radically as soon as I begin to write, it is no longer near, it is no longer mine, and the meaning which language and form carry within them creates a distance, turns it into something else, at best a text which refers to an experience but does not itself contain it, at worst a text full of pretension written by a man unable to contain his emotions. ”

“The implicit notion that literature might actually change the world, or our way of perceiving it, since to this way of thinking the world too is a fiction of sorts, was not something I thought about when I read either Borges or Foucault, and the insights they gave rise to were wholly absent from my writings from that time, they belonged to another circuit and soon sank in the mire of my subconscious”

“This was what I had been longing for. This was writing. To lose sight of yourself, and yet to use yourself, or that part of yourself that was beyond the control of your ego. And then to see something foreign appear on the page in front of you. Thoughts you had never had before, images you had never seen. It was the form that created them, for if what I put into the writing was my own and familiar to me, the form changed it, and that change demanded that I put something else into it, which in turn was transformed, so that even without moving I was moving away from myself. And that is exactly how it is to read, isn’t it? Certainly, we open ourselves to another voice, which we turn into ourself, for when we read, what we feel are our own feelings, our own fear and enthusiasm, sorrow and joy, and when we reflect the reflections are our own, performed by our own self, but only as apprehended by the other, annexed by the other.”

“This ultimate authenticity, this presence in and of the world, is partially sacrificed by the novel in favor of form, which makes it possible to convey crucial insights into relationships in particular, but also into courses of events, psychological patterns, and social structures. That must be why it felt almost like a shock to read Turgenev after Tolstoy, it brought you so much closer to the landscape, the people, the culture, because that’s where you were going and nowhere else: to that particular barn on that particular evening, for instance, and that must also be why I didn’t believe in what I was writing when I tried to tell what happened in the form of a novel.”

“First and foremost, freedom. For if I took this path, if I just wrote things down exactly the way I had experienced them, in my own name, it was as if all my worries about style, form, literary means, characterization, tone of voice, distance, all this vanished at a stroke, as if the literary side of it suddenly became mere make-believe, and superfluous: I could simply write. But it wasn’t just this sudden freedom which lent it force, it was also that there was something unheard-of about it, that it was in a sense forbidden. I was a novelist, I wrote novels, and if I used something from my own life, it had to be camouflaged, a part of the fiction. To renounce this was not among the possibilities open to me as a writer. For then it would no longer be literature.”
