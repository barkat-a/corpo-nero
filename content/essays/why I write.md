# why I read (and why I didn't write)

For the longest time, despite wanting to write, I didn't. For one, I always conflated doing poorly in school at writing to being some innate deficiency. I thought may be good writing comes easily to others but is only painstaking difficult for me. Like a teacher at some point should've told me, "wow your writing is great, I should write more". I finally see the wisdom behind Tyler Cowen's [advice](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/10/high-return-activity-raising-others-aspirations.html) on the high-return activity of raising others’ aspirations. I would have started sooner. So, instead of writing, I just read.

Reading can be done passively, without judgement and inner criticism. I read a lot. I enjoyed reading longer form essays, newsletters and articles (checkout: [[a list of every blog or newsletter I've ever read]]). I felt like an article exploring a topic in 20-30 minutes was an ideal length to . Anything shorter would be too surface level. I found this length be lower stakes and opportunity cost than a book. However, reading long-form book reviews really highlighted what books would be worth reading and made my reading list grow. If someone can write a 10,000 word review on a book, there must be enough density and thought provoking insight to warrant a read. I deleted social media and would fill any idle and in-between time with reading on my read-it-later app, Pocket. Most people online sharing in the top percentile of pocket readers were around 1M words. I don't know where this put me, but my lowest year on pocket is 2.8M words. One year, I had read 32.6M words:

I think this is the most I've ever seen, of the screenshots shared. It's surprising how much small 'transitory' time adds up. Also, surprise the more you read the larger your reading list grows. I don't know how much I've retained of all these years but I'm glad to have read it and refined my tastes to know what I like reading and where the density of information I want to learn about lies. It's crazy what a little FOMO and imposter syndrome can do for motivation. In some ways, this essay is an elaborate way to use this screenshot, as I don't live in the Bay Area and cannot show it to people at parties.

# kipplerization

Reading great writing, only deepened my conviction that I should not write. I had nothing important to say or it had already been said, better, by someone else. I thought reading more would eventually make my ideas worth sharing and writing worth reading. After having read fairly widely, it seems so much  of what is written goes unread. I was afraid of contributing to this kipperlization of information on the internet:

> “Kipple is useless objects, like junk mail or match folders after you use the last match or gum wrappers or yesterday's homeopape. When nobody's around, kipple reproduces itself. For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more."

― Philip K. Dick, *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*

Initially, seeing LLMs and generative AI advance, I wondered if the future would just be different agents reading and writing to each other. However, I've come out of the other side of these fears and anxieties. I now see writing now as a way of stress testing ideas and a tool for clarifying thought. A way of galvanizing and 'steelmanning' arguments. Writing things down, even if no one is reading them, shows holes and gaps in thinking. You may have glossed over a detail which the argument hinges on. I, now, see the value in honing a thought overtime. Overcoming the fear and doubt of not knowing something as well as I thought I did and hope to be better because of it. I'll end with a quote from Patrick Collison, one of the co-founders of Stripe on how writing makes knowledge more rigid, allowing for ideas to develop faster and writing in an organization allows discrepancies to be noticed and addressed:

>*I think there are actually really considerable benefits on both sides because for the reader, it's not just that it's maybe more efficient to communicate stuff through text, though in many cases it is. But also there's this intertemporal benefit where future readers can try to understand the through line and the thought process that led us to this point. And I think that's very considerable. But it's also true that I think that, I write things and lots of people write things in order to organize one's own thoughts. And if that ability was taken away from me, I think I'd be meaningfully less effective so how exactly those balance out is hard to say.*

>*Maybe... They're not actually separable. That's my answer. Literate cultures are just a different thing. I don't mean literate in some faux intellectual way. I just mean, maybe 'textual cultures' is a better term here where Bruno Latour spoke about how he thinks part of how the printing revolution like Gutenberg's caused the scientific revolution was by making knowledge more rigid. Where before, if some observation didn't match some claim, you can always shrug and be like, "Well, the person who transcribed that thing just made a mistake or whatever." And so by making things more rigid, it's easier to break them. And then you can notice discrepancies between, the theory or the claim or whatever. Patrick Collison (01:30:03): Then you can notice discrepancies between I guess the theory or the claim or whatever and the actual reality. And I think there's some version of that organizationally where, I mean, I'm not drawing that precise parallel, but there are analogous dynamics where the nature of oral cultures and contextual cultures are just quite different. And the kinds of collaboration that are possible and the kinds of consistency that can be achieved, it is just fundamentally different. And is front or rear wheel of the bicycle more valuable? I guess theoretically you can have a unicycle, but as a practical matter, you do just need both.*

# working in public vs. working in stealth

Writing is a powerful tool for clarifying your thoughts, but if you want to accelerate your ideas even further, you ought to embrace the power of working in public. The internet has opened up spaces for niche communities to thrive, allowing writers to connect with like-minded individuals who can help sharpen their thinking and uncover new insights.

When you write in a vacuum, you risk getting caught in self-reinforcing loops and biases. By publishing your writing online, even if it's just a draft, you open yourself up to feedback and criticism that can help you identify blind spots and refine your arguments. This process of learning in public can be uncomfortable at times, but it's the fastest way to get to the right answer.

Many writers hesitate to publish their work online for fear that no one will read it. While it's true that the internet is a vast space and it can be challenging to find an audience, the benefits of cultivating even a small readership are immense. As Henrik Karlsson notes in his post *[A blog post is a very long and complex search query to find fascinating people and make them route interesting stuff to your inbox](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query)*, "The more precise and niche the words I input, the better the internet would match me with people I could forge meaningful relationships with." Finding just a handful of engaged readers who share your niche interests can provide invaluable feedback and help refine your ideas in ways that would be difficult to achieve through other means. 
# why you should read anything I write

This blog, by design, is made to allow publishing to be as frictionless as possible. As perfect can be the enemy of good enough and execution is everything, I hope to write ideas as they come to me. Through incubation  and refinement overtime, I aim to keep these notes [evergreen](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes). 

I hope to add or frame things in unique ways or synthesize combine discipline which usually do not collide. I'm constantly asking what generalizable conclusions can be drawn from reading something, which could be applied from one domain to the other. How can this change or challenge our conventional understanding of this phenomena? If this sort of thing interests you, I hope you will keep reading.

“The problem with an essay like this is that if I take on the first role and discuss my private reasons for writing, which have to do with wanting to be seen, wanting to be someone, with ambition and desire for success, I will come off as self-centered, shallow, and more than a little stupid, while if I focus on the other two roles, the existential side of writing and the function of writing in society, I will seem conceited, self-important, and perhaps also megalomaniac. But as it happens, writing is precisely about disregarding how something seems in the eyes of others, it is precisely about freeing oneself from all kinds of judgments and from posturing and positioning. Writing is about making something accessible, allowing something to reveal itself. Whatever it is that reveals itself may well be something already known, for there is hardly anything uncharted in the human psyche or in the world anymore, but it has to show itself unguardedly, with a kind of trust.”
