*Well, I think failure is massively overrated. Most businesses fail for more than one reason. And so when a business fails, you often don’t learn anything at all because the failure was over determined. You will think it failed for Reason 1, but it failed for Reasons 1 through 5. And so the next business you start will fail for Reason 2, and then for 3 and so on. And so I think people actually do not learn very much from failure. And I think it ends up being quite damaging and demoralizing to people in the long run. And my sense is that the death of every business is a tragedy. It’s not some sort of beautiful esthetic where there’s a lot of carnage, but that’s how progress happens. And it’s not some sort of educational imperative. So I think failure is neither a Darwinian nor an educational imperative. Failure is always simply a tragedy.*

Some the worst management mistakes I've seen is mangagers that haven't done role below them. They're just "professional managers". Kind of like a chef overseeing a kitchen that's really good at managign resturant p&l, scheduling etc., but lacks culinary craftsman ship.
This sort of kitchen can eb scucessful if incentives are trightly aligned (people have equity) but ultimately managment is a giant principal agent problem 

This is not always a good hueristic - neccesary but not suffcient for a good manager. I've had bad managers in the past and they focus on legibiltiy. This turns workplaces into a servielance amazon piss jug culture. Ulitmately, you should hire great, high agency, trust people, if you cannot afford them, hire at least one in a managment or cross-functional generalist role like Gokul Rajoram said. IF not than have hungry new grads that are eager to learn. Give them responsiblity but also
