the og answer engine: magic 8-ball


My thoughts on answer engines

I'm not sure what separates search engine vs. answer engine. You can see first iterations of this space as AskJeeves. which in my adolesent brains understand was a way of getting an answer to a question you had. however, it becomes much more complex in what is meant by right answer. Having been terminally online, I want to say my life has been incredibly enriched in more ways than I could reliably fathom by tacit and other knowledge gained through reading stuff on the web and watching people smarter than me teach me. 

I think this has completely unlocked pockets of knowledge for many people around the globe and advertising has made this feasible for many content creators. I also want to acknowledge the precarity of being a web 2.0 creator and these platforms leave a lot to be desired for both the consumer and creator in terms of aligned incentives and ownership.

However, the topic I want to explore in the essay is the concept of an answer engine and various iterations of trying to create such a thing on the internet. This is an incredibly vast topic - i don't want to start with boring definitions like a typical survey course - what is an answer engine and when did they begin (was socrates the first answer engine?).

This article is basically a whole excuse to talk about how underwhelming the experience of perplexity has been for me compared to other AI tools but overall how big of an improvement they are from the enshittified internet plagued and cheapened by SEO. I want to talk about how its built on the back of people's labor who freely shared their knowledge on wikipedia or stack overflow etc., ultimatley making this information more accesible with better ui and conversational interface being a good thing. This type of thing should've been open source like Open AIs orginal mission. My thoughts are mixed (i think its exploitive that people moderate and share their knowledge for fake  internet points, then the forum gets swooped up by a PE firm / advertiser backlash or IPO readiness that prostitues the content and bastardizes the platform ultimately killing it deviating from the initial mission (adpocalypse, reddit etc.,)) I think this needs to be a whole other article but it kind of bums me out that this happens.

The other big issue now is the concept of kipple of misinformation accumulating and brave new world vs. 1984 level of the lesser of two evils is not being uninformed but being overburdened with lies that it will exhaust your ability to discern truth. This is all trite opinons that have alread been expressed in more eloquent formats (black mirror episode around deep fakes etc.,,) this has been theorized ad nausem, but a more incidious and subtle form of this is that if you currently cannot pay for the correct information you will like waste your time/money searching and trying shitter quality of information. The most obvious is pay walls but other is forms of social capital.
For instance many companies want someone from a tier one brand on their resume so they can operate at the effcciency frontier of knowledge and bring it to their company. however, you cannot join these companies unless you have other experiences or grades. So you stay at subpar firms and toil around in suboptimal processes and never learn something that through apprenticeship might save you hours, days, weeks. 

For instance, in my cooking journey I've probably spent countless hours and dollars cooking crap recipes from high-production quality channels. Now I've figured out 3-5 channels which are good. If you followed these you would save 1000s of hours in saved time and money wasted on ingredients of cooking crappy food but it would elevate your life considerable, enrich your family life increase zest and epicuriean impluse. But you might never come across these because there's 100000000 mediocre crap masquerading as highend (premium mediocre) that will be just good enough to say meh., this is good. 

If you go looking for information these days and get frustrated going down disappointing rabbit holes. You will die a thousand deaths before they bury you.

Other cases where you'll pay this tax. I spent probably 3-6 hours daily for 4+ years reading different online sources to not feel guilty about reading some crap that gets passed around. I know what I like, I know where the depth is and I'm happy.
