I've been reading the novel the Tar Tar Steppe and witnessing the impacts of widespread lay offs in tech. I've also been intrigued at the advancement of AI. I'm not well informed enough to take a side on the debate around acceleration, AI doomerism, or alignment. However, I am currently thinking about the future of work and cultural entropy.  In contemplating the intersections of technological progress, societal shifts, and the unfolding complexities of human existence, I find myself drawn to the recognition that amidst our pursuit of innovation, we must also reckon with the philosophical debts and systemic shortcomings that emerge, reminding us of the imperative to foster adaptability and resilience across all facets of our evolving world.

1. *Problem Solving* 
   I'm currently reading Chevallier's "Strategic Thinking" and Conn & Maclean's "Bulletproof Problem Solving". I'm trying to hone a more structured approach to solving ambiguous problems.
2. *Coordination Problems, Incentives, and Organizational Glue*
   This is still a vague idea but I intend to write more and compile a reading list for this.
