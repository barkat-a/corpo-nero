1. Writing - I'm working on a 4-part series on alienation within the context of modern capitalism and bureaucratic structures. I've been watching advancement This is inspired by the work of Mark Fisher, Byung Chul-Han and the fiction novel *The Tartar Steppe*. 
2. Reading - I'm slowly working through "*The Rise and Fall of the EAST: How Exams, Autocracy, Stability, and Technology Brought China Success, and Why They Might Lead to Its Decline*" by Yasheng Huang

1. *Problem Solving* 
   I'm currently reading Chevallier's "Strategic Thinking" and Conn & Maclean's "Bulletproof Problem Solving". I'm trying to hone a more structured approach to solving ambiguous problems.
2. *Coordination Problems, Incentives, and Organizational Glue*
   This is still a fairly abstract concept, I'm trying to think through. I've compiled a tentative reading list: [[coordination problems, incentives, and organizational glue]]. 
3. *Company and industry profiles*
   I'm planning to write profiles on certain companies and industries partially inspired by work like acquired.fm podcast and other business deep dives.
