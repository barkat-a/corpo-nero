# why I didn't write

For the longest time, despite wanting to write, I didn't. For one, I always conflated doing poorly in school at writing to being some innate deficiency. English being my second language I was always slow, in a basic sense of reading and writing but overall in terms of processing power of engaging with ideas. I was always translating them in my mind. However, eventually a switch flipped within me, I become more fluent in English than my mother tongue. I'm able to process thoughts, and communicate ideas faster (albeit still slow). 

I surrounded myself with people much smarter than me, and I thought I would always have to compete with them so I should find something I can be top percentile in. 

In order to write with authority, I needed some credentials

I thought I was bad at it and didn't think I had anything important to say or it had already been said, better, by someone else. I was weak at writing academically. I see writing now as a way of stress testing ideas and a tool for clarifying thought. I think it quickly shows where there's weak points in my reasoning and I don't know something as well as I thought I did.

For instance, if you go to bed leaving any kipple around your apartment, when you wake up the next morning there's twice as much of it. It always gets more and more."

With generative AI, so much content is created every day it accumulates is most of what's written goes unread. I was afraid of cumulating to this kipperlization of the web. I was of afraid of saying nothing worth a damn in the abyss. I spent a lot of time working with LLMs and can confidently say that they still have a long way to go. I believe they're great for starting and curbing writers block but truly great work still is human craft. I intend to write more about this in the future.

A large part of this was also intimidation of gaining writing credentials or other bona fides [^1] to signal that what I was writing was worth reading. However, I have accepted I will never say anything original and have seen enough people express poor / misinformed opinions on the internet, and have gained enough mimetic confidence to reproduce this signal with minimal regard for my reputational / character hit. No enough diary-posting, but I'm hope if any of these limiting beliefs have held you back maybe it would help you venture into similar endeavors with boldness.

# working in public vs. working in stealth

Aside from looking stupid or being on the wrong side of the culture war and getting character assasinated, working in 

work in stealth gives you a shield to criticism or delays user feedback. I some ways its probably the most pure creatively, if you have a chaste vision of what you want to create and don't want feedback adulterating you're idea. IT's prefereable to protect this and create somethign purley fhow you want it. (or you can create albums like kanye and use feedback to chop up). 

1. I write to clarify my thoughts and if no one reads it - that's ok as I would have further crystalized my opinons 
2. However, a big byproduct if your writing gets read is that you'll find like minded people - what is the price of finding a adjacent thinker in an obscure mix of similar tastes/prclivities to accelerate your learning. The amount of mistakes or deadends you can find for them and vice versa would take you orders of magnitude longer if you're toiling away in obscruity.

- Working in public
	- community , learning, refining ideas
- Collecting prestige / bon fides
- Kipplerization 
	- saying nothing into the abyss




 you would be able to develop a unique voice that is more refined and robust, more so than if you writing alone or with limited dist.
	2. clarifying tool 
	3. internet feedback loop / learning in public / quickest way to get to the right answer is to post wrong answer



# why you should read anything I write

I hope to write about or point you to things that you might like which might be hard to find or surface otherwise. I hope to add or frame things in unique ways or synthesize combine discipline which usually do not collide. I'm constantly asking what generalizable conclusions can be drawn from reading something, which could be applied from one domain to the other. How can this change or challenge our conventional understanding of this phenomena? If this sort of thing interests you, I hope you will keep reading.
